# Tutorial Images Directory

This directory is intended for storing images used in the DND Neural Network tutorial.

## Image Naming Convention

Images should be named according to the section they belong to:

- intro.png - Introduction section
- interface.png - Interface Overview section
- adding-layers.png - Building Models section (adding layers)
- connecting-layers.png - Building Models section (connecting layers)
- layer-params.png - Building Models section (layer parameters)
- select-dataset.png - Training Models section (selecting dataset)
- training-params.png - Training Models section (training parameters)
- start-training.png - Training Models section (starting training)
- training-progress.png - Training Models section (monitoring progress)
- accuracy-loss.png - Visualizations section (accuracy and loss charts)
- confusion-matrix.png - Visualizations section (confusion matrix)
- export-options.png - Exporting Models section (export options)

## Image Requirements

- Images should be in PNG format
- Recommended size: 800x450 pixels
- Maximum file size: 500KB

If images are not available, the tutorial will display placeholder images.
